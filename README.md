### About

Ward is a simple and minimalistic server monitoring tool. Ward supports adaptive design system. Also, it supports dark theme.
It shows only principal information and can be used, if you want to see nice looking dashboard instead looking on bunch of numbers and graphs.
Ward works nice on all popular operating systems, because it uses [OSHI](https://github.com/oshi/oshi).

### Config

If you want to change Ward's configuration, you can edit `setup.ini`. When using Docker, use the environment variables `WARD_NAME`,`WARD_THEME`, `WARD_PORT` to automatically regenerate this file at startup. Using any environment variable listed will enable the defaults below and immediately start Ward without the GUI setup. 

| Setting         | Env var         | Description                                  | Default |
|-----------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------------|---------|
| serverName      | WARD_NAME       | Name shown in the interface.                 | Ward    |
| port            | WARD_PORT       | Port to listen on.                           | 4000    |
| theme           | WARD_THEME      | Either `light` or `dark`.                    | light   |
| enableFog       | WARD_FOG        | Either `true` or `false`.                    | true    |
| backgroundColor | WARD_BACKGROUND | HexColor for background when fog is disabled | default |

Environment variables take priority and will regenerate this file with your variables. If no environment variables are set, `setup.ini` is generated once you navigate to Ward's webpage and complete the initial setup. You can also make this file yourself before starting Ward, and place it in the same directory.

For example:

```ini
[setup]
serverName = my-server
theme = dark
port = 8200
enableFog = true
backgroundColor = #303030
```
